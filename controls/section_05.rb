  desc  "
    This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.

    The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).

    Rationale: The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced.

    If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password.

  title "(L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '60 or fewer days, but not 0'"
  desc  "
    This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.

    Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire.

    Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.

    The recommended state for this setting is 60 or fewer days, but not 0.

    Rationale: The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access.

    This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days.

    The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s).

    Rationale: Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.

  title "(L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)'"
  desc  "
    This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps \"pass phrase\" is a better term than \"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.

    The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).

    Rationale: Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.

  title "(L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set to 'Enabled'"
  desc  "
    This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords.

    When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:

    * Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters

    * Be at least six characters in length

    * Contain characters from three of the following categories:

    * English uppercase characters (A through Z)

    * English lowercase characters (a through z)

    * Base 10 digits (0 through 9)

    * Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)

    * A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.

    Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as \"!\" or \"@\". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    Rationale: Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with several publicly available tools.

    This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator manually unlocks them.

    Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.

    The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).

    Rationale: A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific account. Once you configure the Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number of failed attempts. If you configure the Account lockout duration setting to 0, then the account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it manually.

    This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting.

    If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.

    The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).

    Rationale: Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.

    This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.

    **Note:** Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers.

    Rationale: Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.

    The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:

    * All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner.
    * All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.
    * All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.
    * The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.
    This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.

  desc  "
    This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.

    Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators and (when the **Hyper-V** Role is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\\Virtual Machines.

    Rationale: Users who have the **Create symbolic links** user right could inadvertently or maliciously expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to change the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a Denial of Service attack.

    This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network, which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely.

Using a domain-hosted service account is strongly preferred over making an exception to this rule, where possible.

    Rationale: Users who can log on to the computer over the network can enumerate lists of account names, group names, and shared resources. Users with permission to access shared folders and files can connect over the network and possibly view or modify data.

    The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a client to connect&#x2014;for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes&#x2014;to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.

    Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started.

    Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist:

    * The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.
    * The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token.
    * The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.

    This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also determines which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the **Back up files and directories** user right.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

    **Note:** This user right is considered a \"sensitive privilege\" for the purposes of auditing.

    Rationale: An attacker with the **Restore files and directories** user right could restore sensitive data to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install backdoors for continued access to the computer.

    **Note:** Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.

    This policy setting determines which users who are logged on locally to the computers in your environment can shut down the operating system with the Shut Down command. Misuse of this user right can result in a denial of service condition.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

    Rationale: The ability to shut down Domain Controllers and Member Servers should be limited to a very small number of trusted Administrators. Although the **Shut down the system** user right requires the ability to log on to the server, you should be very careful about which accounts and groups you allow to shut down a Domain Controller or Member Server.

    When a Domain Controller is shut down, it is no longer available to process logons, serve Group Policy, and answer Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries. If you shut down Domain Controllers that possess Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) roles, you can disable key domain functionality, such as processing logons for new passwords &#x2014; one of the functions of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator role.

Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords.

    This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console.

    Rationale: Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on.

Be sure to also change the default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console). On Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the built-in Administrator account that was established when the domain was first created.

    Rationale: The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.

    The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password.

    This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities present in Windows Vista.

    The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to be configured to Enabled.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    **Important:** Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant impact on system performance.

    Rationale: Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to track events at a per-system or per-user level. The larger event categories created too many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find.

    This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason.

    If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

    Rationale: If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also, an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely force a computer shutdown.

A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver.

    An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.

    This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Classic - local users authenticate as themselves.

    **Note:** This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services).

    Rationale: With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected. Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared system resources.

    Rationale: When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), services running as Local System and using SPNEGO (Negotiate) that revert to NTLM use the computer identity. In Windows 7, if you are connecting to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, then a system service uses either the computer identity or a NULL session.

    This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.

    The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.

    With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.

    When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

    Rationale: The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be managed centrally in most managed networks.

    This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash.

  title "(L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM'"
  desc  "
    LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:

    * Join a domain
    * Authenticate between Active Directory forests
    * Authenticate to down-level domains
    * Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP
    * Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain
    The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM  NTLM.

    Rationale: Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.

    The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM  NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.

    This policy setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients that issue LDAP BIND requests.

    **Note:** This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind (ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use ldap_simple_bind or ldap_simple_bind_s to communicate with a Domain Controller.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Negotiate signing. Configuring this setting to Require signing also conforms to the benchmark.

    Rationale: Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.

  desc  "
    This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in Administrator account.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    Rationale: One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named \"Administrator\" because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways:

    * If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator.
    * If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted.
    Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.

    This policy setting controls whether User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess or UIA) programs can automatically disable the secure desktop for elevation prompts used by a standard user.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

    Rationale: One of the risks that the UAC feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of its activity. This setting allows the administrator to perform operations that require elevated privileges while connected via Remote Assistance. This increases security in that organizations can use UAC even when end user support is provided remotely. However, it also reduces security by adding the risk that an administrator might allow an unprivileged user to share elevated privileges for an application that the administrator needs to use during the Remote Desktop session.

    Rationale: Some malicious software will attempt to install itself after being given permission to run. For example, malicious software with a trusted application shell. The user may have given permission for the program to run because the program is trusted, but if they are then prompted for installation of an unknown component this provides another way of trapping the software before it can do damage

    This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system. Secure locations are limited to the following:

    * &#x2026;\\Program Files\\, including subfolders
    * &#x2026;\\Windows\\system32\\
    * &#x2026;\\Program Files (x86)\\, including subfolders (for 64-bit versions of Windows)
    **Note:** Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of the state of this security setting.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    Rationale: UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an administrator. This is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers that are transmitting user interfaces to alternative forms. A process that is started with UIAccess rights has the following abilities:

    * To set the foreground window.
    * To drive any application window using SendInput function.
    * To use read input for all integrity levels using low-level hooks, raw input, GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInput.
    * To set journal hooks.
    * To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity input queue.

    This policy setting controls whether the elevation request prompt is displayed on the interactive user's desktop or the secure desktop.

    Rationale: Standard elevation prompt dialog boxes can be spoofed, which may cause users to disclose their passwords to malicious software. The secure desktop presents a very distinct appearance when prompting for elevation, where the user desktop dims, and the elevation prompt UI is more prominent. This increases the likelihood that users who become accustomed to the secure desktop will recognize a spoofed elevation prompt dialog box and not fall for the trick.

    This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).

    **Note:** If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before deploying.

    Rationale: Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.

    This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:

    * 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
    * 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
    * 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
    * 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
    * 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.
    * 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
    * 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.
    * 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.
    * 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.
    * 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.

  desc  "
    In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool, which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved Sysadmins when needed.

    The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers. Please see the LAPS documentation for details.

    LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a domain.

    **Note:** Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique  complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.

    **Note #2:** LAPS is only designed to manage **local** Administrator passwords, and is therefore not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.

    Rationale: Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

    Rationale: Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

    This setting controls whether local accounts can be used for remote administration via network logon (e.g., NET USE, connecting to C$, etc.). Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems. Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.

    **Enabled:** Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed from the resulting access token. This configures the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 0. This is the default behavior for Windows.

    **Disabled:** Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 1.

    NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    Rationale: The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.

    An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production environment.

    The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

    Rationale: In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of the [MS15-011](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS15-011) / [MSKB 3000483](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000483) security update. This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (NetworkProvider.admx/adml) was also provided with the security update.

    Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:

    \\\\*\\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

    \\\\*\\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

    **Note:** A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the above paths.

    Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here: [Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014](http://blogs.technet.com/b/askpfeplat/archive/2015/02/23/guidance-on-deployment-of-ms15-011-and-ms15-014.aspx).

  desc  "
    Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials. When using credential delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host. The Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are two options to help protect against this risk.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    **Note:** More detailed information on Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and how it compares to Restricted Admin Mode can be found at this link: [Protect Remote Desktop credentials with Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/remote-credential-guard)

    Rationale: **Restricted Admin Mode** was designed to help protect administrator accounts by ensuring that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that could potentially be compromised. **Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard** helps you protect your credentials over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting Kerberos requests back to the device that is requesting the connection. Both features should be enabled and supported, as they reduce the chance of credential theft.

    This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each boot-start driver:

    * Good: The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with.
    * Bad: The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do not allow known bad drivers to be initialized.
    * Bad, but required for boot: The driver has been identified as malware, but the computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver.
    * Unknown: This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection application and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver.
    If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to initialize the next time the computer is started.

    If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.

    This policy setting sets the default behavior for Autorun commands. Autorun commands are generally stored in autorun.inf files. They often launch the installation program or other routines.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not execute any autorun commands.

    Rationale: Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun command is inserted, the system will automatically execute the program without user intervention. This creates a major security concern as code may be executed without user's knowledge. The default behavior starting with Windows Vista is to prompt the user whether autorun command is to be run. The autorun command is represented as a handler in the Autoplay dialog.

Setting a value of 0 applies to enterprise, EDU, IoT and server devices only. Setting a value of 0 for other devices is equivalent to choosing a value of 1.
    * A value of 1 - Basic sends only a basic amount of diagnostic and usage data. Note that setting values of 0 or 1 will degrade certain experiences on the device.
    * A value of 2 - Enhanced sends enhanced diagnostic and usage data.
    * A value of 3 - Full sends the same data as a value of 2, plus additional diagnostics data, including the files and content that may have caused the problem.
    Windows 10 telemetry settings apply to the Windows operating system and some first party apps. This setting does not apply to third party apps running on Windows 10.

    Rationale: Data could be forwarded from the user's Remote Desktop Services session to the user's local computer without any direct user interaction.

    This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a password prompt for users who log on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they already provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    Rationale: Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. If the server that runs Remote Desktop Services allows users who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their password, then it is possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's computer could connect to a Remote Desktop Server through the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut, even though they may not know the user's password.

    This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that typically are available only to system administrators.

  title "(L1) Ensure 'Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received' is set to 'Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more days'"
  desc  "
    This policy setting determines the level of Preview Build or Feature Updates to receive, and when.

    The Windows readiness level for each new Windows 10 Feature Update is classified in one of 5 categories, depending on your organizations level of comfort with receiving them:

    * **Preview Build - Fast:** Devices set to this level will be the first to receive new builds of Windows with features not yet available to the general public. Select Fast to participate in identifying and reporting issues to Microsoft, and provide suggestions on new functionality.

    * **Preview Build - Slow:** Devices set to this level receive new builds of Windows before they are available to the general public, but at a slower cadence than those set to Fast, and with changes and fixes identified in earlier builds.

    * **Release Preview:** Receive builds of Windows just before Microsoft releases them to the general public.

    * **Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted):** Receive feature updates when they are released to the general public.

    * **Semi-Annual Channel:** Feature updates will arrive when they are declared Semi-Annual Channel. This usually occurs about 4 months after Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), indicating that Microsoft, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), partners and customer believe that the release is ready for broad deployment.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more days.

    **Note:** If the \"Allow Telemetry\" policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.

    **Note #2:** Starting with Windows Server 2016 RTM (Release 1607), Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called **Dual Scan**, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured**or** configure the setting **Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update** (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links:

    * [Demystifying &#x201C;Dual Scan&#x201D; &#x2013; WSUS Product Team Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wsus/2017/05/05/demystifying-dual-scan/)

    **Note #3:** Prior to Windows Server 2016 R1709, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS. Starting with Windows Server 2016 R1709, the maximum number of days you can defer is 365 days.

    Rationale: Forcing new features without prior testing in your environment could cause software incompatibilities as well as introducing new bugs into the operating system. In an enterprise managed environment, it is generally preferred to delay Feature Updates until thorough testing and a deployment plan is in place. This recommendation delays the **automatic** installation of new features as long as possible.

If you configure this policy setting to Enabled, the operating system will recognize when a network connection is available and then use the network connection to search Windows Update or your designated intranet site for updates that apply to them.

    After you configure this policy setting to Enabled, select one of the following three options in the Configure Automatic Updates Properties dialog box to specify how the service will work:

    * 2 - Notify for download and auto install **(Notify before downloading any updates)**
    * 3 - Auto download and notify for install **(Download the updates automatically and notify when they are ready to be installed.) (Default setting)**
    * 4 - Auto download and schedule the install **(Automatically download updates and install them on the schedule specified below.))**
    * 5 - Allow local admin to choose setting **(Leave decision on above choices up to the local Administrators (Not Recommended))**
    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    **Note:** The sub-setting \"**Configure automatic updating:**\" has 4 possible values &#x2013; all of them are valid depending on specific organizational needs, however if feasible we suggest using a value of 4 - Auto download and schedule the install. This suggestion is not a scored requirement.

    **Note #2:** Organizations that utilize a 3rd-party solution for patching may choose to exempt themselves from this setting, and instead configure it to Disabled so that the native Windows Update mechanism does not interfere with the 3rd-party patching process.

    Rationale: Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

  desc  "
    This policy setting determines whether Windows will suggest apps and content from third-party software publishers.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    Rationale: Enabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display suggested apps as well as images from the internet.

  title "(L1) Ensure 'Prevent users from sharing files within their profile.' is set to 'Enabled'"
  desc  "
    This policy setting determines whether users can share files within their profile. By default, users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their network after an administrator opts in the computer. An administrator can opt in the computer by using the sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

    Rationale: If not properly configured, a user could accidentally share sensitive data with unauthorized users. In an enterprise managed environment, the company should provide a managed location for file sharing, such as a file server or SharePoint, instead of the user sharing files directly from their own user profile.

  desc  "
    This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions when it installs any program on the system.

    **Note:** This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.

    **Caution:** If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.

    The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

    Rationale: Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.
